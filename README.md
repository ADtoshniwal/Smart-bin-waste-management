## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React:** Used for building the user interface components of the smart bin application.
- **Chart.js:** Utilized for generating interactive charts and visualizations to display data.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Employed for styling the components and providing a responsive design.

### Backend

- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system used for storing and managing data.

### Hardware

- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** Utilized as the hardware platform for the smart bin application.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Used for measuring the distance between the sensor and the waste level in the smart bin.
- **Master-Slave Architecture:** Implemented using the ESP-NOW protocol for communication between multiple ESP32 microcontrollers.
